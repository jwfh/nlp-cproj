\subsection{Heterogeneous Computing}
One test case was to give the application an except (included below) of a research paper on heterogeneous computing \cite{noahpaper}.
\textfile{Heterogeneous Computing Test File}{HeterogeneousComputing.txt}
For this file we requested that the application return five sentences. The sentences returned were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The usage of the CPU as a generalized process, and the GPU as an accelerator to the CPU has been a common practice just before and continuing after 2010.
	\item This configuration offers significant performance benefits in a system, particularly in data-parallel, and computationally heavy process.
	\item Heterogeneous system architecture is used to leverage the value of each unique device, The CPU being well designed for tasks were latency is critical, while the GPU is the choice processor in throughput-oriented tasks.
	\item This creates two different classifications; a latency compute unit (LUT) being a general CPU, and a throughput compute unit being a general GPU.
	\item CPUs are composed of a few large, flexible, and fast clocked cores, while GPUs are built using thousands of cores that are both smaller and slower, but are highly parallelized.
\end{enumerate}
