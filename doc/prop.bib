Therefore, techniques are developed for identifying and extracting relevant information from the cases. A broader application of these techniques could considerably simplify the work of the legal profession.",

	abstract = {Abstract Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstractors, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems. This necessitates the creation of high quality abstracts. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract. But clearly, an abstract can also be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods of the automatic abstracting system is warranted. This abstract was produced by the system described in this paper.}

For extractive text summarization in which representative sentences from the document itself are selected as summary, various statistical, knowledge based and discourse based methods are proposed by researchers. The goal of this paper is to give a survey on the important techniques and methodologies that are employed using Genetic Algorithms in Automatic Text Summarization. This paper gives a review of the growth and improvement in the techniques of Automatic Text Summarization on implementing Evolutionary Algorithms techniques. We propose a broad set of features that considers additional features in the fitness function."

	abstract={As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet, condensing the important information in the form of summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to identify areas where further research is needed.},

The aim of the text summarization is to select the most important information from an abundance of text. This paper investigates a new approach for single document summarization based on graph traversal technique with constraint to improve cohesion. The selection of features plays a vital role in the sentence extraction. By considering both the structured and the unstructured features, better summary can be generated.},
