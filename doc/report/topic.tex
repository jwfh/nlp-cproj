Text summarization, or automatic abstracting, is the process of reducing an input text to a smaller, more concise version of itself. Motivation to study computerized text summarization stemmed from curiosity about the mechanisms used in an automatic abstraction PowerShell script found years ago on the Internet \cite{PSScript}. Further research has shown automatic abstraction's usefulness in many interesting fields, including but not limited to the legal and medical professions, scholarly research, and search engine result sorting and summarization.
