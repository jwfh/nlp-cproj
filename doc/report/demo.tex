\subsection{Heterogeneous Computing}\label{sec:het}
One test case was to give the application an except (included below) of a research paper on heterogeneous computing \cite{noahpaper}.
\textfile{Heterogeneous Computing Test File}{HeterogeneousComputing.txt}
For this file we requested that the application return five sentences. The sentences returned were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The usage of the CPU as a generalized process, and the GPU as an accelerator to the CPU has been a common practice just before and continuing after 2010.
	\item This configuration offers significant performance benefits in a system, particularly in data-parallel, and computationally heavy process.
	\item Heterogeneous system architecture is used to leverage the value of each unique device, The CPU being well designed for tasks were latency is critical, while the GPU is the choice processor in throughput-oriented tasks.
	\item This creates two different classifications; a latency compute unit (LUT) being a general CPU, and a throughput compute unit being a general GPU.
	\item CPUs are composed of a few large, flexible, and fast clocked cores, while GPUs are built using thousands of cores that are both smaller and slower, but are highly parallelized.
\end{enumerate}

We think that this summary is fairly accurate. It effectively retrieves important sentences from the sample text that define hetergeneous computing and explain why computing on a CPU is different than on a GPU in terms of throughput and the structure of the two types of processing units.

\subsection{Harry Potter}
The next test case being demonstrated is the use of the software with an excerpt from the first chapter from J.K. Rowling's {\em Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix} \cite{harrypotter}.
\textfile{Excerpt from Chapter 1 from {\em Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}{HarryPotter.txt}

With this text file as the input, the software recommended a summary of 15 sentences. This was chosen and the output was as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze.
	
	\item Harry Potter's appearance did not endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby.
	
	\item In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below.
	
	\item He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle.
	
	\item She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again.
	
	\item The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays.
	
	\item Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children.
	
	\item Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.
	
	\item The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o'clock news reached Harry's ears and his stomach turned over.
	
	\item If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers.
	
	\item He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles --- an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident...but the baggage-handlers' strike was followed by news on the drought in the Southeast (``I hope he's listening next door!'' bellowed Uncle Vernon, ``with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!''); then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband (``as if we're interested in their sordid affairs,'' sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
	
	\item Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, ``And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer.
	
	\item He rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.
	
	\item A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys' living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword.
	
	\item But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys' open window, and the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
\end{enumerate}

This summary is not as good as the one demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:het}. This text, being the first chapter of a children's book, contains a great deal of description and plot-filling information, and consequently does not explain a single idea. Instead there are many ideas being discussed and the summarizer fragmented these thoughts even more. 

This is not to say that the summary is useless; it does mostly make sense to read. Rather it pales mainly in sentence~5 --- where the reader is left to wonder who {\em she} is --- and in sentences~10 and 11 --- in which the detail was omitted that Harry was listening for information on the Muggle news about catastrophes that could be fallout from larger, more serious events occurring in the magical world.

Interestingly, the summarizer has chosen to include sentences~2 and 3, which discuss Harry hiding in the flower bed below the living room window, and then mention him hitting his head on the window in sentence~15. In this sense, one can argue that despite the summary being in bullet-point form, and having fragmented the meaning of the text by picking a set of not necessarily consecutive sentences from the original text, the use of identical words in multiple sentences to tie together meaning appears to be quite effective in maintaining coherence.
