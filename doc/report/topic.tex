Text summarization is the process of reducing an input text to a smaller, more concise version of itself. Motivation to study computerized text summarization --- referred to by the term {\em automatic abstracting}  by those in the field --- stemmed from curiosity about the mechanisms used in an automatic abstraction PowerShell script found years ago on the Internet \cite{PSScript}. Further research has shown automatic abstraction's usefulness in many interesting fields, including but not limited to the legal and medical professions, scholarly research, and search engine result sorting and summarization.
