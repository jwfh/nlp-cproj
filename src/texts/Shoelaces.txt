Tie a Left-over-Right Starting Knot as shown, then make both ends into "loops" by simply doubling them back onto themselves. People often refer to these as "Bunny Ears".Cross the two loops over each other so that the right (blue) loop ends up in front and the left (yellow) loop ends up behind. The yellow loop is now the right loop.Begin to wrap the right (yellow) loop around the left (blue) loop to end up in front.At the same time, begin to wrap the left (blue) loop around the back. You will end up with the ends of both loops on opposite sides of the "hole" in the middle.Feed both ends of the loops through the hole in the middle. The right (yellow) loop goes out the back and the left (blue) loop comes out the front.Now, simply pull the loops to tighten the knot. The whole twisted mess of the previous drawing will rearrange itself into a neat finished knot. Trust me, it works!
