Though there are context-free morphophonological phenomena, context-free grammars are primarily used to both recognize and parse sentences relative to a syntactic grammar. Parsing both recognizes and adds an internal structure to a sentence; in the case of syntactic parsing, this structure is the hierarchical constituent phrase-structure of the sentence, cf., Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. As mentioned previously, this phrase-structure parse tree is useful as a model of the semantics of a sentence. Parsing a sentence S with n words relative to a grammar G can be seen as a search over all possible parse trees that can be generated by grammar G with the goal of finding all parse trees whose leaves are labelled with exactly the words in S in an order that (depending on the language, is either exactly or is consistent with) that in S. Though some algorithms implement the generation of one valid parse for a given sentence much quicker than others, the generation of all valid search trees (which is required in the simplest human-guided schemes for resolving sentence ambiguities) for all parsing algorithms is in the worst case at least the number of valid parse trees for the given sentence S relative to the given grammar G. There are natural grammars for which this is quantity is exponential in the number of words in the given sentence (BKL, p. 317; Carpenter (2003), Section 9.4.2).
